## Inspiration

We wanted to create an innovative healthcare solution that is both useful for patients as well as caretakers. We saw the Xbox Kinect as a perfect physical data visualization tool, capable of analyzing recovery and progress for physical therapy patients while also giving physicians valuable information and feedback.

## What It Does

KinectPT analyzes and records progress for the following exercises: arm raises, leg raises, and shrugs. It looks at a patient, measure arm,leg, or shoulder raise degrees and keeps track of improvements, letting the patient know if they were able to raise their arms higher than the day before, etc. KinectPT then graphs this data and displays the information on a web dashboard for patients and caretakers to view. During the exercise, an awesome robot head also interacts with the user and gives exercise instructions.
